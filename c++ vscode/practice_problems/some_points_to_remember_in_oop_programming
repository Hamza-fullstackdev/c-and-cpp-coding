// very important first point
1. If we want to access the private members in derived class use function with its type "int"
and return the variable from it.

// Second point
2. Always make sure before writing a program that which class inheritance type you 
need to solve a problem.

//Third point
3. Always remember in class inheritance that you have to type public,private,protected after
the new class.

//fourth point
4. In hybrid inheritance use the variable to display data, it will work for public and protected variable only
Don't use "cout<<Function_name()" and use public and protected classes.

// fifth point
5. Virtual keyword is very important see the program "virtual_class_practice_1.cpp".

// sixth point
6. We can assign values to the constructor in inheritance from derived class to base class
see "how_to_get_value_to_the_constructor_while_inheriting.cpp" for that purpose
